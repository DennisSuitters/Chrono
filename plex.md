- Step 1
  - Sign in to your PLEX server using your web browser. You can do this by just double clicking on the PLEX Media Server icon in the notification area of the taskbar if you’re using windows.
- Step 2
  - After you’ve done that, go to one of the shows you want to add to your Smart Playlist and click the edit icon. I opened Chicago Med.
- Step 3
  - Click on Tags and write a name for the collection (Smart Playlist) in the Collections field (I used Chicago Franchise). Then click save changes.
  - Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all the shows you want to add to the Smart Playlist. For the Chicago Franchise i’ll do this for Chicago Fire and Chicago P.D..
- Step 4
  - On the TV Shows Home Page, make sure that episodes is selected in the dropdown menu.
- Step 5
  - On the TV Shows Home Page, click on the hamburger icon (the 3 stripes) and after that click on the new filter button.
- Step 6
  - Click on Collection.
- Step 7
  - Click on the name you gave your collection in step 3. For me that’s Chicago Franchise. After having done that, click on the back icon in front of (to the left of) collection.
- Step 8
  - Click on the back icon in front of (to the left of) select a filter.
- Step 9
  - Click on Air Date until the little arrow faces upward. After that click on the add to playlist icon.
- Step 10
  - Give the playlist a name, here I used Chicago Franchise. Click the ADD button and voila you have a Smart Playlist.
